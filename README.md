On the need for configurable travel recommender systems:  
A systematic mapping study
=====================================================================================

Introduction
------------

This website provides the replication package for the paper titled "**On the need for configurable travel recommender systems: A systematic mapping study**". The replication package includes all the necessary resources and instructions to reproduce the mapping study presented in the paper. This web page provides supplemental material related to the article titled “On the need for configurable travel recommender systems: A systematic mapping study“ and submitted to the 32nd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization. This paper aims to map studies under the travel recommender systems (TRS) field, with a focus on the configurability these systems have to offer to providers. It assists in identifying relevant works in the literature and analyzes the lack of points that are yet not covered by the authors. Eventually, a future work is proposed, aiming to solve this lack in the literature and provide more support to TRSs providers.

Research queries
----------------

For this paper, we searched for terms related to the work in the domain of travel recommender systems, narrowing it down to configurable (and similar terms) recommender (and similar terms) systems for tourism (and similar terms). The search includes the titles of works, their abstracts, and keywords, to support our analysis effectively. Moreover, we limit our query to works published within the past 10 years considering journal and conference papers. We execute our final query on three digital libraries: Scopus, IEEE, and DBLP. It is possible to visualize the queries in the respective libraries below:

**SCOPUS**

*TITLE-ABS-KEY ( configurable OR personali\* OR customi\* ) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY (recommender OR advis\* OR assist\* OR suggest\*)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH((tourism OR eTourism) AND travel) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA,"COMP" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2013) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2014) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2015) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2016) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2017) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2018) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2019) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2020) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2021) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2022) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR,2023) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE,"English" ) ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( EXACTKEYWORD,"Recommender Systems" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( EXACTKEYWORD,"Advis\*" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( EXACTKEYWORD,"Tourism" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( EXACTKEYWORD,"Assist\*" ) OR LIMIT-TO ( EXACTKEYWORD,"Suggesti\*" ) )*

**IEEE**

*(("All Metadata": configurable OR personali\* OR customi\*) AND ("All Metadata": recommender OR advis\* OR assist\* OR suggest\*) AND (("All Metadata": tourism OR eTourism) AND travel))*
> In the IEEE library, the time range filter must be applied right after fetching all the results since the library does not contain a command to do so directly through the query.

**DBLP**

*configurable | personali | customi recommender | advis | assist | suggest tourism | eTourism*
> In the DBLP library, the time range filter must be applied right after fetching all the results since the library does not contain a command to do so directly through the query.
